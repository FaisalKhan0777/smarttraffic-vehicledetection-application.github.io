# web-based-application
A web-based application that enables users to upload transportation-related images (such as traffic camera images) and perform object detection on those images.

Dependencies:

npm install @tensorflow/tfjs @tensorflow-models/coco-ssd
@tensorflow/tfjs: TensorFlow.js library for machine learning.
@tensorflow-models/coco-ssd: COCO-SSD model for object detection.

Running the Application:

 Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000 (or the port number specified by the server if you changed it).


Testing the Application:

1.Upload an Image: Once the web application is loaded in your browser, you can use the provided interface to upload an image for processing.
2.View the Processed Image: After uploading the image, the application will process it using TensorFlow.js and Coco-ssd to detect vehicles and display the processed image with bounding boxes around the detected vehicles.

Additional Instructions :
1.Ensure you have a stable internet connection during the first run to download TensorFlow.js and Coco-ssd models.
2.Make sure your browser supports JavaScript and has permission to access your local files for image uploading.
3.If you encounter any issues, check the console in your browser's developer tools for error messages.
